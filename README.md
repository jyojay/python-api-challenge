# python-api-challenge
This repository consists of:
- Folder WeatherPy with files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb consisting of the code I wrote as a solution and analysis to this challenge using Jupyter notebook.
- Folder WeatherPy also consists of an output_data folder with cities.csv, Fig1.png, Fig2.png, Fig3.png & Fig4.png generated output files from code in WeatherPy.ipynb

# Note:
Jupyter notebook was used for coding

# Assumptions: 
- Current open weather data is used and not historical data which cannot be used for future planning in real world
- I have used ideal weather condition of max temp > 29 and < 34, wind speed < 45 and cloudiness of 0 for narrowing down city_data_df dataframe for my purpose
-  "lang": "en" is used while getting hotel data but some hotel names still comes up in local language even though other attributed like address come up in english on checking
-  Other translators are not used for converting to english but could be used in solving a real world problem
